# About the project  
The objective is to perform real estate data exploration near the city of Toulouse.
Your company (Immo-Inv) is a real estate agency who wants to understand very
well the real estate market in Toulouse and its suburbs. You are the big data
analyst of the company and you have access to a 5-years real data history of
houses and apartments sales transactions in Toulouse and its suburbs. The
dataset contains details for each transaction: sale date, localization (city, postal
code), type of residence, type of sale, land area, living area, number of rooms,
price, etc.).
You should use Spark for this analysis because you should be able to apply your
analysis to a dataset with the entire real estate market in France for instance (big
data file). But for presenting your key results, you can of course use python
visualization libraries such as seaborn or other librairies.
Challenges here are to explore all possible aspects of this real estate market
(variables, relationships between variables, trends, patterns, outliers, etc.).
