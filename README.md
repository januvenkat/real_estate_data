#Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real estate data for Toulouse and its suburbs. Immo-Inv, a real estate agency, aims to gain a deep understanding of the local real estate market. The dataset spans five years and includes details of houses and apartment sales transactions in Toulouse and its surrounding areas.

The goal of this analysis is to explore various aspects of the real estate market, identify relationships between variables, uncover trends, and detect patterns or outliers. The analysis is designed to be scalable, allowing for application to larger datasets, such as the entire real estate market in France.
